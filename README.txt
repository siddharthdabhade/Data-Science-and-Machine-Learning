ML Experiments - Realistic Sample Package
-----------------------------------------
This ZIP contains:
- dashboard.html : Interactive single-page dashboard (open in browser)
- datasets/ : Representative real-world-style small sample datasets (for classroom demo)
- notebooks/ : 15 Jupyter notebooks (skeletons with instructions & code snippets)

NOTE: The environment used to create this package is offline. Datasets provided are
realistic and representative but small samples (to keep file size manageable). If you
want full-scale Kaggle datasets, provide links or I can fetch them later with internet access.
